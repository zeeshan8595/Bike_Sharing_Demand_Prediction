# Bike_Sharing_Demand_Prediction
Bike Sharing project Prediction Seoul Bike Sharing Data set
The system for rental bikes is introduced and gaining popularity in many urban to sub urban areas that help in facilitating the comfort in the transportation system and drastically reduces the pollution levels that play a major role in achieving the green mobility concept. With growing demand the availability and accessibility are the challenges to be crucially addressed that leads in reducing the waiting time. In order to keep track of rented and available bikes with time, stable supply of the rental bikes becomes a major concern. The most important aspect is to predict the bike count required for any given time for the stable supply for the demand. In the presented work the different supervised machine learning algorithms were implemented after critically examining all the features. The performance evaluation was done for each model the optimal model was identified that best suited for the given problem statement.
